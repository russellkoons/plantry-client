Over the last year I've been working to lose weight. While my exercise habits are great, my diet habits are still pretty poor. I created Plantry in an attempt to encourage myself and other dieters to focus more on eating in and making healthier choices.

To use the app, after logging in, go to New Plan in the menu. On the New Plan page the user and use the Add New Meal function to add their favorite homemade meals, which instantly appear on the New Meal Plan form. Once the user has the whole week filled out, they can view their saved plans on the Plans page where they can also edit their plans and meals. Finally when the user wants to go to the grocery store, they open the Shopping List page, pick the plan for the week and instantly get an interactive shopping list with all the ingredients needed for the meals they're making that week!
